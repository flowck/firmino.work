With Git's default configuration every time you create a new repository the initial branch will be set to `master` , this has been the unchangeable rule ever since.

## Changing to another name

<p>To update this configuration globally, you will need to type the following instructions into your terminal:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch new_default_branch_name
```

That's all you need. Happy coding!
