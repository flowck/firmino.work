I've just listened to the podcast episode ["002: Project structure & package name"](https://go.transistor.fm/episodes/002-project-structure-package-name), and I quite liked it because the author puts emphasis on the following aspects:

* Because projects in Go don't have to follow a strict way to organise the folders and packages, it is recommended to start as simple as possible, specially while learning the language.
* Projects can always be refactored to a more appropriate structure.
* There's no need to feel forced into following a certain way of structuring a project, unless of course you are working on an existent project with an already defined structure.

That's all for today.
