- DDD usually requires two approaches: Strategic Design and Tactical Design
- Artifacts should be grouped by (business) context rather than by kind
 
![Packaging via bounded contexts](/posts/packaging-via-bounded-contexts.png)

- When packages of different contexts need to communicate with each other, an Anti-Corruption layer can be introduced.

## Tactical Design

- Value Type ([Value Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/implement-value-objects))
- [Repository Pattern](https://threedots.tech/post/repository-pattern-in-go/)
- A domain struct should not be created with invalid state, nor should it be allowed to have its state invalidated during runtime. 

### Value Type Pattern

A Value Type is equivalent to the Value Object pattern in OOP languages.

### Repository Pattern

- Decouples the domain layer from the data layer. Should the data source change, the domain will not be impacted assuming it's using this pattern.
- Facilitates testing without the need of a real database / service.
